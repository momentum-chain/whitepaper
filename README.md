# Momentum

Momentum is a general-purpose blockchain platform implementing the proof-of-popularity consensus mechanism.

This repository only contains the source code to the (work-in-progress) whitepaper. For an implementation, please see the [momentum-go](https://github.com/momentum-foundation/momentum-go) repository.

There currently is no way to purchase or invest in Momentum as it is not released yet. If you're interested in investing, please sign up to [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com), our official distribution channel.

## Creating the Whitepaper

You can use `pdflatex` to render the Whitepaper PDF. Install it by running `apt install pdflatex` or `dnf install texlive`.

Then run `make` inside the `/src` dir.
